### Simple-QrCodes

I thought it might be usefull to build something that implements some kind of payment service. And i started playing with Laravel so it
seemed naturall. This is a concept that doesnt dive to deep. Basically its a managment aplication, where users through a store system,
can set up their "whatever" for online payment through paypal or stripe. One can track his transactions and requested shippments, and notify customers with 
template emails and generate/download qrcodes for his items, cause so far the point of this service is to alow customers to pay through their phones. All one needs is his payment service API credentials and the whole checkout system is generated with the color theme as a customisable element.

## - Note -
The control panel isn't styled for mobile devices at this point i'll do it soon, the checkout is of course cause it is intended to be used through the phone by the customer.
